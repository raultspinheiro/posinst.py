# posinst.py

## What is it?
The <strong>posinst.py</strong> its a simple script that makes the first linux boot much easier giving automatic commands to install/update packages, configure git, etc...
Much more comming soon!

## How it works
You have to create a text file named "packages.txt" with the name of the packages that you want to install. One line per package.

<strong>THIS SCRIPT WAS CREATED AND TESTED BASED ON UBUNTU 24.04 LTS. IT IS NOT GUARANTEED THAT IT WILL WORK ON ANOTHER LINUX DISTRO</strong>
